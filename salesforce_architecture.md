# Salesforce Architecture

1. At the base is the Salesforce Cloud. It's trusted and multitenant.

   - CRM Data
   - Authentication
   - Access Model

2. On top of the Cloud sits Salesforce Platform.

   - Data services
   - AI
   - APIs
   - Lightning
   - Heroku
   - App Exchange

3. Applications are built on top of the Platform. They provide consistency and powerfull functionality.
   - Used for Sales
   - Customer Service
   - Marketing
   - etc...

**Notes:**

- Salesforce is a cloud company. Everything we offer resides in the trusted, multitenant cloud.

- The Salesforce platform is the foundation of our services. It’s powered by metadata and made up of different parts, like data services, artificial intelligence, and robust APIs for development.

- All our apps sit on top of the platform. Our prebuilt offerings like Sales Cloud and Marketing Cloud, along with apps you build using the platform, have consistent, powerful functionality.

- Everything is integrated. Our platform technologies like predictive analytics and the development framework are built into everything we offer and everything you build.

## Important Things to Know

- **Trust**

  - Trust is the top priority. Companies use Salesforce for vital operations and they need to trust that their data is safe and the platform is functional.

- **Multitenancy**

  - Salesforce is multitenant cloud. Each company has it's own space in the cloud.
  - Trust and multitenancy go hand in hand. Even when sharing resources (in multitenant), you're data is safe and secure.

- **Metadata**

  - This is your data about data. Metadata is also your page layouts, security settings, and any other customizations you’ve made to the structure of your org that collect or use your organization’s data.
  - All of these standard and custom configurations, functionality, and code in your org are metadata. Part of the reason you can move so fast on the platform is that Salesforce knows how to store and serve you that metadata immediately after you create it.

- **APIs**
  - The core of the API’s power is that all of your data and metadata is API enabled.This provide flexibility to move beyond the normal idea of business software and build unique solutions.
