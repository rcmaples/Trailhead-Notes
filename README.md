## Use Cases:

By creating a single custom object, you can totally change how your organization collaborates. High impact, low effort. As you start building with the platform, keep your eye out for processes with:
	- Heavy email collaboration
	- Reliance on spreadsheets
	- Shared local documents
	- Time-intensive, repetitive manual steps
	- Impact on only a few departments (you want to minimize the number of stakeholders while youâ€™re still learning)
Processes with these traits are great candidates for early projects on the Salesforce platform.

Apps:
	Contains a set of objects, fields, and other functionality.
	Waffle Menu will tell you which app you're using.


Objects:
	Standard:
		- Accounts
		- Contacts
		- Leads
	Custom: 
		- "property" (for real estate use case)

	Every time you create a custom object, you automatically get something called Chatter feed tracking. Chatter feed tracking provides a way for multiple people to comment and collaborate on a particular record. The discussions and decisions are stored on the record so everyone can stay up to date on important decisions.

Records:
	Rows in the object database tables. The actual data associated with an object.

Fields: 
	The columns of the object database tables. 

Ex: "DreamHouse" app
	- Property Object
		- Fields:
			- City
			- Price
			- Beds
			- Baths
			- Title
			- Property Name
			- Address
